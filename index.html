            <p>Security is vital to your Linux systems. It’s not a binary thing
	    though. Depending on your requirements you end up choosing a level
	    of security that still allows you and your systems to accomplish
	    what they need to do.</p>
            <p>Here’s info about Cockpit’s security, to help you make those choices.
            You’ll find not only has Cockpit got a solid security story, but you
            can use it in all sorts of different ways depending on what kind of
            security your systems need.</p>

            <h1>Cockpit:<br>a <span class="comment">Linux session</span><br>
                in your browser</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
                <p>Let’s start by stacking the deck against Cockpit. First off it’s
                important to remember that Cockpit is actually an alternative Linux
                session … along side X11, SSH and VT logins. It’s a session in the PAM,
                logind, TTY, SELinux and other senses. The logged in browser and the
                javascript code it is running can interact directly with the system
                as part of that session.

                <pre>
                          proxy = cockpit.dbus("org.freedesktop.hostname1").proxy()
                          proxy.KernelRelease
                          proxy.StaticHostname
                          proxy.SetStaticHostname("marmalade", true)
                          - Switch to terminal
                          hostname
                          hostnamectl set-hostname ZeroG
                          proxy.StaticHostname
                </pre>

                <p>Let's look at some examples, here's the hostnamed call we made earlier.
                We are typing javascript code directly in the interactive console in a
                browser. If you have Cockpit running on your system try this.</p>

                <p>It's trivial to interact with the DBUS API, easier even than if you
                were on the system itself issueing gdbus commands... but that's the point
                ... we are on the system ... logged into the system ... and the javascript code
                here is running as part of the login session.</p>

                <p>Any management system with a browser interface requires a secure browser.
                That includes Satellite, Tower, Foreman, Landscape, CloudForms, cPanel and more.
                If anything like this interacts with your systems, then security bugs in
                browsers have a direct effect on your system security.</p>

                <p>Secondly take a look at any browser based tools that were involved in the
                creation or curation of the software installed on your system, including tools
                used by your Linux distribution.</p>

                <p>If your security requirements are strict and you must avoid browsers at all
                costs, then be sure to audit all possible places that browsers were involved in
                what’s running on your systems. It’s harder than you think.</p>

                <p>Unless your system is extremely isolated and hand crafted, it turns out that
                browsers are already highly involved in many security paths for your systems.
                Cockpit does not change this situation significantly.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
                <p>Cockpit runs javascript code from the system it’s logged into. Obviously
                that code is protected by the standard Same Origin Policy that web
                browsers adhere to.</p>

                <p>But how does Cockpit protect against bugs in the code. How can we be sure
                that only the javascript code installed on the system is run, and bugs are
                not exploited to run code trojaned into logs or other data loaded by Cockpit?</p>

            <p>Content-Security-Policy</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <p>Browsers have a security technology called Content Security Policy which
                is sorta like SELinux or Apparmor in your browser. The policy describes
                exactly where code can be loaded, what can be run, and what sorts of
                connections can be made by the browser.</p>

                <p>In Cockpit’s case we send a strict Content-Security-Policy header that
                only allows code installed in Cockpit packages on the logged into system to
                be run. Although individual parts of Cockpit can override this default, it’s
                rarely done. The default security policy looks like this:</p>

                <pre>
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' connect-src 'self' ws: wss:

                has no special privileges. The credentials of the logged in user start
                a login session, and Cockpit can perform exactly the tasks that the
                logged in user has access to. It has no more or less permissions.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
                <p>So if Cockpit only has the priviliges of the authenticated user, how
                does it perform admin tasks? Well obviously one could log in as root,
                and the logged in session would have all capabilities and access to
                the system.</p>

                <p>But logging in directly as root is a poor security practice. Cockpit
                supports escalating privileges via sudo and/or polkit. If, and only if,
                the logged in user has permission to use sudo or polkit to escalate
                privileges.</p>

                This is as if you log in with SSH and then used sudo -s or similar to
                perform some admin tasks. Try the following command once you’ve logged

            <aside class="notes">
                <p>A good security practice is to run services, processes or tools with the
                least amount of security privilege necessary to perform their task. To
                accomplish this, Cockpit is split up in multiple components, each of which
                runs with as little access to the system as possible.</p>

                <p>On RHEL, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian and any other distro that we distribute
                Cockpit for … we test and make sure that this privilege separation is in
                effect: Including correct SELinux policies, and unprivileged unix users.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
                <p>The cockpit-bridge is the part of Cockpit that runs in the login
                session. It is similar to a login shell, in that it runs with the
                privileges and security context of the logged in user. In the above case
                I logged in as the stef user. If you checked the Reuse my password for
                privileged tasks option on the login screen, you might also see this
                process running as root in which case pkexec or sudo was used (see above)
                to escalate privileges.</p>

                <p>The cockpit-session part of Cockpit is a small binary that performs
                authentication for the logged in user. It uses PAM or GSSAPI to perform
                that authentication. cockpit-session is installed setuid, in such a way
                that it can be launched by the unprivileged cockpit-ws user (see below)
                during user login. This process performs limited tasks, and has a
                restrictive SELinux cockpit_session_t context. Lastly is a reasonably
                short program written in plain C so it is easier to audit.</p>

                <p>This is the component that listens on the network. It hands off
                authentication information to the cockpit-session to perform a login
                and launch cockpit-bridge. The cockpit-ws binary runs as an unprivileged
                unix cockpit-ws user, with a restrictive SELinux cockpit_ws_t policy.</p>

                <p>If this is an issue for your systems, you can use Cockpit over the
                SSH port already have open. But wait, how does that work? Browsers
                don’t natively speak the SSH protocol, and getting a browser to do
                so would be an impressive party trick.</p>

                <p>To use Cockpit over SSH, use a bastion host model: Start cockpit-ws
                on port 9090 on a single host, perhaps even your localhost. Connect to
                that with your browser and use that first Cockpit instance to log into
                to Cockpit on other machines others over SSH. If you draw it up, it

            <p><span class="comment">cockpit-ws</span>: Socket activated, written in C,
            only enough HTTP to load Cockpit into your browser</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <p>Cockpit doesn’t use a web server like Apache, NGINX or Lightttp.
                It doesn’t use an application server like Tomcat. So by and large the
                security concerns related to deploying those projects do not apply here.
                Cockpit implements just enough of an HTTP server to serve the Cockpit
                application to your browser.</p>

                <p>This tiny HTTP server is included in the cockpit-ws process, and
                protected via strong SELinux and unix privilege separation.</p>

                <p>But if you’re environment is uncomfortable with use of the Cockpit
                built-in HTTP server, you can use Cockpit over SSH as seen in
                the section above.</p>

            <p>But suffice it to say, that Cockpit’s security is well thought out,
            layered and matches that of Linux in general.</p>
